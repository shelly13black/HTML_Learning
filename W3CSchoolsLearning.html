		<p>Quote by Summer Sanders:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/summer_sanders_648517?src=t_hard_work">
			To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge.
